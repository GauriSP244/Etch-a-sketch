# Etch A Sketch

An **Etch A Sketch** is a classic drawing toy that allows users to create pictures using two knobs. Each knob controls a stylus that moves horizontally or vertically on the screen, creating lines on the surface. The toy has a gray screen made of a powder-coated aluminum surface, and the lines drawn are made by moving the stylus over the surface and scraping off a layer of the powder.

Once you're done, you can "erase" the drawing by shaking the toy, which redistributes the powder evenly across the screen. Itâ€™s a fun, mechanical toy that challenges creativity and hand-eye coordination.

## Features:
- Two knobs to control the stylus.

## How to Use:
1. Rotate the left knob to move the stylus left and right.
2. Rotate the right knob to move the stylus up and down.

## Additional Information:
The Etch A Sketch has been a beloved toy since its invention in the 1960s, inspiring creativity in both children and adults alike.
